## Questions
Why does this estimator lower the variance compared to the original? 

Can you convince yourself that using delta and estimating on the unlabeled data makes sense (say with a picture). 

What is the subgradient for convex problem (definition)?

## Goals Jan 31
- fix labeled data n = 100, see how the accuracy of the prediction effects the prediction powered inference. What happens when it is 100% accurate or 80% accurate etc.

- Try to work through the mathematics to understand why the coverage probability for the prediction powered inference is still bounded by alpha. That is is the confidence interval method "correct".

- Try to conceptualize the mathemaics. You can draw pictures (or understand the picture in the paper).
